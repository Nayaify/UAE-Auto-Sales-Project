# UAE-Auto-Sales-Project
I carried out this Project to analyze the UAE Auto sales market(January2024 - April 2024) using Power BI to uncover insights about car types, fuel usage, transmission, city-wise performance, Body Type, and top-performing brands and models.

 Tools Used
- Excel (Dataset preparation)
- Power Query (Data transformation)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)

  Dataset
- Source: car_dataset_uae
- Records: 7,677 car sales
- Total Sales Value: AED 2 Billion

 Key Insights
- Luxury cars had the highest number of total sales overall  
- Fairly Used cars aged 2‚Äì5 years contributed the highest total sum of prices
- Dubai recorded the highest volume of sales among all Emirates  
- SUV vehicles were the most frequently sold body type
- Mercedes -Benz was the top-selling car brand  
- The G-class model had the highest total price value
- The Range Rover Model  had the highest unit sales
- Automatic transmission cars sold significantly more than manual ones
- Petrol cars had a much higher sales margin than electric or hybrid
  

  Recommendations Based on Findings
- Dealerships and Importers should prioritize stocking on top selling models and brands to meet demands and maximize profits.
- Marketing Campaigns and promotes should highlight the preperred body type to promote beat- sellng body type and attract more buyers.
- Brands and Models with low sales performance should be reviewd for potential causes, such as pricing, low availabitity, poor marketing. Discount offers and targeted adverstising could help boost their performance.,
- Dealerships and Importers should priortize Automatic Transmission Vehicles, as they show high sales margin
- Dealership and Importers should priportize petrol-powered cars, while gradually introducing more hybrid or electric options as the market beging to shift toward fuel efficiency and sustainability.


 Learnings
-  I Used DAX to build KPIs and dynamic visual filters  
-  I Cleaned and categorized raw car data using Power Query  
-  I Built a report for business leaders to assess inventory demand and pricing trends

 Challenges
- Data Quality Issues, the data contained some missing values, and inconsistent formats which required thorogh cleaning.
- I was only able to get a limited time frame data, so I could not record a season trend or long time pattern.
